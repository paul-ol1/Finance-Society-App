              Investments are a fundamental aspect of the financial world,
              allowing individuals and organizations to allocate their resources
              with the goal of generating returns or achieving specific
              financial objectives. More specifically it is the commitment of
              current resources in the expectation of deriving greater resources
              in the future.

                <h3>Risk and Return</h3>
                <p>
                  The risk-return trade-off is central. Investors seeking higher
                  returns often accept greater risk. Risk management involves
                  diversification and other strategies.

                  Diversifying across assets reduces risk. It helps prevent the
                  performance of one asset from dominating the entire portfolio.
